# Breast Cancer Detection Using ML

#### Project 3 in a series of mini-projects designed to practice practical Machine Learning.

The dataset used can be found in the repository, along with the source code. Training and testing have been done using Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbours. 

> Alternately, the dataset used can be found in the following link: <a> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/ </a>, and the dataset is titled 'breast-cancer-wisconsin.data'.  

**NOTE:** The dataset used is the Wisconsin Standard Dataset. There is another dataset available for Breast Cancer Detection, but we're not making use of that. 



### Cloning the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AnindKiran/Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-ML
cd Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-ML
```

### Prerequisites libraries

It is presumed that you have at least Python 3.7. 
The prerequisites include: sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and numpy. Although using conda would be preferable, the following commands use pip to install libraries considering most people have the 'pip' utility. Use the following commands to install them: 
```sh
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
```

### Using the notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook using the following command on the cmd / terminal (depending on your platform): 
```
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook will be visible for you to use.
